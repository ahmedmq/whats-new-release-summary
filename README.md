# Prerequisites

- Pivotal Tracker [API Token](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/api_token/)
- Open AI Token
- Docker
  - Docker is required to run application locally. Please refer to the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) documentation for more information.

# Getting Started

- From the root of the project, run the [docker-compose.yml](compose.yml) file to start the DynamoDb, Ollama containers

  ```shell
  docker compose up -d
  ```
  This will initiate the download of the Ollama LLM and the LLaMA 3.1 model, both of which are large files.


- Wait until the model is downloaded successfully
  ```shell
  docker ps
  ```
  Once the model is successfully downloaded, only the three containers listed below will be running. 
  ```text
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                             PORTS                      NAMES
